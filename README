This package contains the source materials (code/art/script) for the English 
translation project for the PC-Engine CD game Private Eye Dol.

                    ****************************************
                    
The build system is only set up for Unix-like systems, though none of the code 
is fundamentally dependent on this and could be ported with a bit of effort. 
You'll need GCC, libpng, and ImageMagick (the "convert" utility), as well as any 
dependencies of wla-dx.

You'll first need a disc image of Private Eye Dol for the PC-Engine CD. It 
should match the following specifications:

  Redump name: Private Eye dol
  CRC32:       80d5f718
  MD5:         b8d7b3de039fe5dcaf3149b3da0ae654
  SHA-1:       5502081d84ce4b036b81b35471b56a6cd510c80a

The disc image must be in ISO+WAV+CUE format. If you need to convert from a 
different format, try using bchunk.

Once you have an ISO+WAV+CUE image, rename the files such that every track is 
named as "pidol_01.wav", "pidol_02.iso", and so on up through "pidol_25.wav". 
Copy these files into the "pidol" directory. Then:

$ cd pidol
$ ./build.sh

build.sh should then build all the necessary tools and output the translated ISO 
for track 2 as "pidol_02_build.iso". Use the provided "pidol_iso_build.cue" CUE 
sheet to run the built disc.

Note that translated game text is taken from the CSV files in the "pidol/script" 
directory. While these can be edited directly, it will probably be easier to 
instead work with the ODS files in the same folder, which are formatted ODS 
spreadsheet versions of the same content. Just run "convertscript.sh" before 
"build.sh" to convert the ODS files into the CSVs automatically (requires 
OpenOffice).

If you want to modify the project, check build.sh to see where the resources 
that get inserted into the game are coming from.

is under the terms of whoever wrote it.
